ABSTRACT:
It is very common for university students to forget assignment,
 quiz and project deadlines. Sometimes they do not 
complete them because the lecture resources are placed on the 
university server and they have to go through the hustle of staying
 in university premises in order to copy the files from the required
 folder. Students often have to log in to the desired database 
management system in order to have a look at their attendance. 
This app would provide them the attendance sheet which could be
 viewed from anywhere. Mid-Term marks along with quiz marks 
could also viewed. 
Some students even miss interesting events such ‘GEEK WEEK’, 
‘Softec’, ‘Dramafest’. For them we plan to provide exclusive 
updates if they bookmark the event. Discussion forums could 
be accessed through this app so that students could discuss 
educational issues with everyone in this class, it could be
 regarding assignment or any happening in the class. Resources
 such as reference notes, books, and tutorials all could be 
accessed once we have a running server to which our app would
 connect and access the required information. 
 This application would also allow students to check the
 official website of their respective university and a map 
view is being also added for the benefit of the student so
 that new comers can find their way through the university.
 The scope of this app could be great as more and more students
 tend to buy smartphones. And this would allow them to interact 
with the system in a better and more effective way. Even though
 the current system gives you the same features but the mobility
 is restricted as one could access the database only through the
 wired connection.
